# 🚀 Jesus Rey Gonzalez  
**Computer Science @ UCF • Developer • Builder • Innovator**

Hi! I'm **Jesus**, a bilingual Computer Science major at the University of Central Florida, developer of real-world projects, smart-home systems, Chrome extensions, drone optimization software, and embedded IoT dashboards.

I love solving problems at the intersection of **software, hardware, optimization, and user experience** — whether that’s building home automation servers, creating navigation-assist tools for the web, or optimizing drone routes for power-infrastructure inspection.
